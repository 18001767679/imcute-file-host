Title: "Take patients the shortest path to discharge"<br>
<br>
In this <em>i(editor note:oops!just catched this 202307191925)</em>xkcd comic, entitled "Take patients the shortest path to discharge," we see Black Hat<s>, also known as Mr. Who</s><em>Intentionally named as Mr Who,so as to disguise as the World Health Organization(WHO) and make people convinced of his illadvice</em>, presenting a board filled with suggestions for new ways of treating patients. The comic humorously portrays <s>absurd and unconventional methods</s><em>the "typical" way of curing patients a "mad scientist" who has no medical license would perform/the direct and "intuitive" way of curing patients</em> for addressing various medical conditions.<br>
<br>
Let's break down the suggestions:<br>
<br>
1. Hvpernatr/kalemia: 15-crown-5/18-crown-6:<br>
This suggestion involves using a combination of ligands, specifically crown ethers (15-crown-5 and 18-crown-6), to treat disorders related to abnormal levels of sodium (hyponatremia) and potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood. Crown ethers are cyclic chemical compounds known for their ability to selectively bind metal ions.<em>Crown ethers are hydrophobic on the outside,thus injecting it would also be putting oil in blood,which do not mix and have obvious consequences.Oils are also known to pool up in fat tissue,including the brain,which is mostly fat.Chelating agents,in the medical context,are water soluble,as fat soluble chelating agents wouldn't be turned into urine by the kidneys.Here Black Hat is intentionally confusing chelating agents in the chemistry sense with that in the medical sense.</em><br>
<br>
2. Depression: Shock with taser if d(Depression)/dt < 0:<br>
This tongue-in-cheek proposal suggests using electric shocks from a taser to treat depression. The expression "d(Depression)/dt" refers to the rate of change of depression over time, implying that patients who show a decreasing trend in their depression levels should be subjected to this unconventional approach.<em>Here Black Hat is confusing this with (his wrong understanding of)Coginitive Behavioral Therapy.</em><br>
<br>
3. Primary thrombocytosis: Cut patient in different parts of the skin to make clots:<br>
The suggestion here is to address primary thrombocytosis, a condition characterized by the overproduction of platelets in the blood, by deliberately cutting the patient in various areas to induce the formation of blood clots. This idea is clearly exaggerated and not based on any valid medical practice.<br>
<br>
4. Hypermagnes/cobaltemia: Chlorophyllide/"amin-t!":<br>
This proposal suggests using chlorophyllide, <s>a pigment found in green plants</s><em>chlorophyll without the magnesium ion,as ChatGPT says(so don't blame me if that's wrong)</em>, and <s>a truncated or incomplete term "amin-t"</s><em>"amin-t",a humorous unscientific name for cobalamin without the cobalt ion,as cobalamin-cobalt=amin+(-t) if literally understanded literally</em> to treat conditions related to excess magnesium (hypermagnesemia) and cobalt (<em>hyper</em>cobaltemia) in the blood<em>via chelating to the metal ions and becoming the normal chlorophyll and cobalamin</em>. It's important to note that neither chlorophyllide nor the mentioned term "amin-t" are established medical treatments for these conditions.<em>Note:Cobalamin is a proper medical treatment for cyanide poisoning,as it can bind to cyanide ions to form cyanocobalamin,or vitamin B12.</em><br>
<br>
5. Pulmonary fibrosis: Defibrillate:<br>
The last suggestion humorously proposes using a defibrillator, typically used to restore normal heart rhythm, to treat pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic lung disease that leads to the formation of scar tissue in the lungs. <s>This depiction is clearly meant to be comedic and illogical.</s><em>This is the wrong understanding of the word "defibrilate"."de" means to remove,"ate" means the process of,and "fibrilla" means fiber or thread,<b>but used here to mean a heart condition called fibrillation,an erratic heart beat rhythm.The "fibr" in "fibrillation" means cardiac muscle fibers,instead of scar tissue.</b></em><br>
<br>
<s>It's noteworthy that this comic is satire and is not meant to be taken as medical advice.</s>(editor note:delete reason:not needed in a comic explanation.ChatGPT makes fine prints every time I ask it a question that contains stuff that could potentially harm living organisms.) The comic uses absurd and nonsensical ideas <s>to highlight the importance of evidence-based and scientifically validated treatments in the field of medicine.</s><br>
(Additional prompt after I found that I forgot to ask for the title text explanation)<br>
The title text for this comic provides additional<s> context and inspiration for the </s>depicted suggestions. It mentions "FOP," which stands for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the abnormal formation of <em>misplaced(editor note:clarification that the resulting bone is misplaced and abnormal/incorrect,because the following explanation refers to them as "the misplaced bones")</em>bone in muscles, tendons, and other connective tissues. The comic uses humor to propose an overly drastic and absurd approach to treat this condition.<br>
<br>
The suggested treatment plan described in the title text includes several exaggerated and unconventional steps. First, it proposes breaking or removing every misplaced bone, even including new ones that may form. This idea is extremely drastic and unrealistic, as breaking bones<em> or repeatedly performing the surgery to remove bones</em> would cause significant harm to the patient.<em>"Untill patient stops growing" because the following steps requires replacing bones with artificial ones,which don't grow,so the patient has to wait until his/her bones no longer grow(longer)</em><br>
<br>
The next step involves <em>either</em> injecting antibodies that specifically target osteoblasts, which are responsible for bone formation. <s>This proposal is intended to hinder the bone-forming process.</s> <s>Additionally,</s><em>or</em> EGTA <s>is mentioned as </s>a substance to be injected in controlled amounts, as excessive amounts may <em>cause too much hypocalcemia,so it will</em>potentially interfere with muscle signaling.<em>and other processes.Black Hat continues trying to look professional by listing out a potential problem and its consequences.</em><em>This proposal is intended to hinder the bone-forming process.</em><br>
<br>
The final step suggested in the title text is replacing the patient's bones with artificial ones made of metal. This idea implies substituting the patient's natural bones with metal implants to prevent their dissolution alongside the misplaced bones.<br>
<br>
The title text concludes with a humorous remark about forgetting to write the date <em>on the comic/beside the title</em> again, indicating that this comic strip was created on July 19th<s>, although the year is not specified.</s>(editor note:delete reason:superfluous)<br>
<br>
<s>It is essential to note that the proposed treatment plan in the comic is entirely fictional and not based on any medical or scientific evidence.</s>(editor note:superfluous fine print,again) The exaggerated ideas presented <s>serve as comedic devices to highlight the absurdity of such approaches within the context of medical treatments.</s><em>make jokes about Black Hat's prankfulness,this time to misguide doctors to perform incorrect and potentially deadly medical procedures on patients,disguising himself as a member of the WHO.This prank would most likely succeed,as the doctors have brains to figure out that the report is false.</em>
